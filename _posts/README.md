# Writing blog posts

Blog posts should have filenames that look like this:

```yyyy-mm-dd-title-with-spaces-replaced-with-dashes.md```

Each filename should start with three dashes, a title, then three more dashes, like:

```
---
title: My blog post
---

Here is the content of my blog post`
```

The content is written in "Markdown" - [here is a guide on Markdown formatting](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)
