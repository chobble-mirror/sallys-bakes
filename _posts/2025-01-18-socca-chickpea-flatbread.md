title: Socca-chickpea flatbread
---

I saw socca on a menu and my search began. What is it ? What’s in it? And how do I make it?
So it’s a flatbread originating in France, made with chickpea flour and it’s very simple to make.

The recipe I followed was as usual American so measurements are in cups and the method mentions cooking by broiling! Oh dear! Luckily that’s just American for what we call grilling, phew!

Now, chickpea flour can be found under different names mine was called gram flour but you might find it as garbanzo flour.

The recipe also called for za’atar! This is available in supermarkets in the herbs section but I didn’t want to go shopping so looked it up and cobbled together my own spicy/herby mix.

My first attempt (picture above) was a little too thin for my liking so as luck would have it I came across a very attractive.......yes I know it’s a frying pan, but we all have our little pleasures in life and maybe I’m easily pleased!

Anyway the second attempt with said attractive (pictured below) pan was slightly thicker and more bread like.

This socca has a pancake/omelette texture but it slices like a bread and holds together so works well as a way to scoop up dips and so I think you can call it a flatbread.
