# Blog Images Folder

You can upload images to this folder to embed them into the blog

It's important to resize images before embedding them - very large images will load very slowly

You can use [this website at squoosh.app](https://squoosh.app/) to compress images - you should resize so the largest size is 1000px or less, and then compress with `MozJPEG` at about 75% quality - this will result in very high quality images which still load quickly.
