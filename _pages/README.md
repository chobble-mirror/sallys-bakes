# Editing Page Content

The page content is written in Markdown - [click here for a Markdown formatting guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)

There are two special pages:

- [not-found.md](not-found.md) - People hit this page if they visit an invalid URL
- [thank-you.md](thank-you.md) - People hit this page after sending an enquiry

Each page starts with a block surrounded by three dashes, like below:

```
---
title: My Page Title
heading: My Heading
description: My Meta Description
---

The content of the page, with images, formatting, etc
```
