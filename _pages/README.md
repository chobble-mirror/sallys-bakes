# Editing Page Content

The page content is written in Markdown - [click here for a Markdown formatting guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)

Here are descriptions of each of the pages:

- [home.md](home.md) - The homepage
- [menu.md](menu.md) - The menu page
- [contact.md](contact.md) - The contact page
- [blog.md](blog.md) - The blog post index page
- [reviews.md](reviews.md) - The reviews page

There are two special pages:

- [not-found.md](not-found.md) - People hit this page if they visit an invalid URL
- [thank-you.md](thank-you.md) - People hit this page after sending an enquiry

Each page starts with a block like the below, surrounded by three dashes:

```
---
layout: DO NOT CHANGE THIS
linkText: DO NOT CHANGE THIS
order: DO NOT CHANGE THIS
permalink: DO NOT CHANGE THIS
metaTitle: A short description of the page - this will show in search results
title: The title of the page
subtitle: The subtitle of the page (can be empty)

The content of the page, with images, formatting, etc
```
