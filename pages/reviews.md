"ordered a delivery of pies and all were delicious. the pastry is one of the nicest I think I've ever tried! just perfect. ordering and delivery were easy and communication was great. thank you x"

"OMG Thankyou, I've been feeling really sorry for myself as I'm breastfeeding a baby with numerous allergies. I contacted Sally's bakes asking if she offered any Soya free products and she was able to make then soya free for me. they taste amazing too... my only issue is they arent calorie free so I'm not going to fit through the door by the end of the week. I can't reccomend Sally's bakes enough and have already shared your page with a friend. x"

"Would highly recommend! Ordered basically all of sally pies and pasties to try. So far all have been great! I particularly love the chorizno pies and the cluck free pies are amazing. Also ordered the cream eggs and they were way bigger than I expected and taste amazing, ordered two one for me and my partner and I ended up eating both of them 😂"

"Loving Sally’s Bakes. I love that the kids love them. Fab to have in the fridge or freezer for winning teen snacks! Absolutely delicious x"

"Sally made a beautiful Christmas pie for my vegan friend who came to visit. She absolutely loved it. The pie was huge and there was a generous filling inside. She took the rest home and shared with her dad and brother who aren’t vegan but said the pie was great! Will definitely be returning to purchase some more amazing bakes from Sally! Xx"

"Delicious pies and cakes ! so good !"

"I visited the craft fair at Bolton’s Albert Halls today and Sally’s bakes had a stall there , so I purchased a veggie pastie a mushroom and chestnut pie and a roast veggie pie , I must say they were all particularly lovely ,I however liked the veggie pastie best . As a person who has followed a veggie diet for over 30years it’s nice to see a business persuing a very varied vegetarian offering . Fabulous ! I shall certainly be visiting your stall at Bury market in the near future ."

"Absolutely delicious !! We came to Bury Market especially for Sally’s Bakes and I have to say - not only is Sally absolutely lovely, but her bakes are super delicious !! We will be back !! Xx"
